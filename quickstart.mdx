## Make your first API call

Test that the API is running by calling the health endpoint:

```bash
curl https://api-verifier-2.onrender.com/health
```

You should receive:

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "timestamp": "2024-01-15T12:00:00.000Z",
  "service": "MT5 Monitor API"
}
```

## Create an account

Register a new user account:

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-verifier-2.onrender.com/web-register \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "firstName": "John",
    "lastName": "Doe",
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword123"
  }'
```

## Login and get your token

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-verifier-2.onrender.com/login \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "email": "john@example.com",
    "password": "securepassword123"
  }'
```

The response includes your user info and sets an authentication cookie.
