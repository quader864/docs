## Base URL

All API requests should be made to:

```
https://api-verifier-2.onrender.com
```

## Authentication

The API uses JWT tokens for authentication. After logging in, the token is set as an HTTP-only cookie. For programmatic access, you can also pass the token in the `Authorization` header:

```bash
Authorization: Bearer <your-token>
```

### Public endpoints (no auth required)

- `GET /health` - Health check
- `GET /api/sentiment` - Get sentiment data
- `GET /api/blog` - Get public blog posts
- `POST /login` - Login
- `POST /web-register` - Register

### Protected endpoints

All other endpoints require authentication. Some endpoints also require specific roles (moderator or admin).

## User roles

| Role | Permissions |
|------|-------------|
| **user** | Create posts, like posts, edit own posts |
| **moderator** | All user permissions + approve/reject posts |
| **admin** | All permissions + manage users and roles |

## Rate limiting

The API implements rate limiting to prevent abuse. If you exceed the limit, you'll receive a `429 Too Many Requests` response. Wait a few seconds before retrying.
