## Overview

The blog system supports creating posts, a moderation workflow, and user engagement through likes.

## Post visibility states

| State | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `draft` | Saved but not submitted for review |
| `pending` | Submitted and awaiting moderator approval |
| `public` | Approved and visible to everyone |
| `rejected` | Rejected by moderator with feedback |
| `deleted` | Soft-deleted (hidden but not removed) |

## Create a post

```bash
curl -X POST https://api-verifier-2.onrender.com/api/blog \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <your-token>" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{
    "title": "My Trading Strategy",
    "contentRaw": "# Introduction\n\nThis is my trading strategy...",
    "summary": "A detailed look at my trading approach",
    "tags": ["strategy", "trading"],
    "coverImageUrl": "https://example.com/cover.jpg",
    "publish": true
  }'
```

Set `publish: false` to save as draft, or `publish: true` to submit for approval.
